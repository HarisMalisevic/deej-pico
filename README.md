# deej-pico

deej is an **open-source hardware volume mixer** for Windows and Linux PCs. It lets you use real-life sliders (like a DJ!) to **seamlessly control the volumes of different apps** (such as your music player, the game you're playing and your voice chat session) without having to stop what you're doing.

This is the original repo: [https://github.com/omriharel/deej](https://github.com/omriharel/deej)

This is my attempt at supporting the Raspbarry Pico for Deej volume mixers.
There might be other forks attempting or even achieving this but I want to use this as a learning opportunity.
